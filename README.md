125g unsalted butter
100g plain flour
100g rye flour
1 tsp sea salt
flakes, plus extra for sprinkling
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda
200g light brown soft sugar
100g golden caster sugar
1 large egg
plus 2 large yolks
1 tsp vanilla extract
200g chocolate
chopped into small chunks (choose dark or milk, or a mixture of the two)

step 1
Melt the butter in a small saucepan until sizzling. Watch it carefully – the butter will 
foam, and, when the foam subsides, it will turn from yellow to a hazelnut brown.
At this point, remove from the heat, tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Meanwhile, mix the flours, salt, baking powder and bicarb together in a bowl and set aside.

step 2
When the butter is cool, tip in the sugars and beat with a wooden spoon to combine.
Add the egg, yolks and vanilla and beat together. 
Scrape the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until it all comes together into a dough. 
Fold in the chocolate, then chill for at least 3 hrs, or until firm. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.

step 3
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. 
Separate the dough into 12 pieces, weighing for accuracy if you like. Roll each piece into a ball using your hands, then put six balls on each sheet, leaving space between them for spreading. 
Bake for 10 mins, then, one sheet at a time, remove from the oven, sprinkle with some sea salt and slam the sheet hard against your work surface.

step 4
Bake for another 3 mins, then repeat the slamming of the sheet. 
Bake for 3 mins more. This timing will give you soft cookies, but if you prefer them a bit firmer, cook for a few minutes longer. 
Leave to cool on the sheets for 10 mins before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
